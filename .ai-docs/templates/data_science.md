2. **Key Findings/Objectives**: What is the notebook trying to achieve or prove?
3. **Methodology**: Briefly describe the steps taken (e.g., Data Loading, Preprocessing, Model Training, Evaluation).
4. **Key Code Components**: Highlight important functions, classes, or code blocks used.
   - Description
   - Purpose
5. **Dependencies**: List key libraries used.

Here is the content of the notebook (raw format):
